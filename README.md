# MHN

## Building

Clone the repo. From the root directory, run `go build`. You should now have a binary in the root directory, `mhn`.

## Running MHN

You can run it with the default settings by just executing ./mhn from the root directory. You can configure the server's port by using the `--port [port]` parameter.
